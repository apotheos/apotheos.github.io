If you told me a week ago that you could host a blog using GitHub without having to jump through too many hoops,
I would have been very skeptical. Now, not so much. So how did I get here?

I've know about GitHub pages for quite some time, but they always looked cumbersome and difficult to maintain to me.
Perhaps I had not looked enough into it, perhaps I believed them to fit a very small use case. More likely, I thought
both. What I didn't know is that GitHub supports a static site framework called Jekyll.

I'm a senior at North Central College studying Computer Science with side interests in English and Classics. It's not all
books with me though; I also have a general love of learning, programming, climbing, enjoying a spontaneous cup of tea and travelling.

This blog is a place for me to explore my interests by sharing things I find fascinating and helpful. Although the primary
subject of this blog is Computer Science, I'll occassionally publish posts on other experiences completely unrelated to
Computer Science.

Currently I'm a software developer at VG-Bio --- a local biotechnology startup --- where I started as an intern nearing
two years ago. It's a position where I'm always learning, and it's helped me grow as a programmer. I have helped develop
large parts of our REST API in PHP, our Python SDK for the REST API, and now our Android phone application. My breadth of
software work has allowed me to dive into new technologies and get up to speed on the right way of doing things with it
quickly.

At college, I'm the Editor-In-Chief for the Kindling --- North Central's humor magazine --- and President and a founder of
Noctrl, the college's Computer Science organization. I've been involved with each for three and two years respectively and
I've enjoyed everything I've learned and the people I've worked with. Working with motivated people and motivating others
myself is a pleasure that I hope I will be able to experience wherever I go.

That's enough about me for now. If you have any questions or article suggestions, comment on an article or hit me up on
Google+ or Twitter.
